## It's raining Gold 

<img src="./gold.gif"/>

My wife is an artist and today she asked me for help on an installation, where – on a wall projection – 
there's an endless stream of gold, which visitors can collect. Having never done any graphical work I stumbled
on [processing.org](http://processing.org) and created an initial version. 


## Running locally

You'll need to download Processing and the Video-Export Processing library as well

1. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)
2. Download [VideoExport Library](https://funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing/download/VideoExport-23.zip)
3. Unzip and move it into your ```Processing/libraries``` folder

## Where to go from here?

Let's make it shine! let's add some fog, let's make it crisp, shiny and valuable!
