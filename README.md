## It's raining Gold 

<img src="./gold.gif"/>

My wife is an artist and today she asked me for help on an installation, where – on a wall projection – 
there's an endless stream of gold, which visitors can collect. Having never done any graphical work I stumbled
on [processing.org](http://processing.org) and created an initial version. 

## Where to go from here?

Let's make it shine! let's add some fog, let's make it crisp, shiny and valuable!
